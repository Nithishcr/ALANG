{"name":"Alang","tagline":"A simple Interpreter which uses python for its implementation.","body":"This Project is a result of a long time dream of creating my own interpreter using python.\r\n\r\nNow lets choose a name , Lazy to google cool names for new language so lets name it Alang(Anush Language).\r\nHope it goes cause... well... it got my name for starter XD.\r\nI use python for the interpreter implementation since I am very comfortable with it. I am not going to use a virtual environment since I have decided to build this interpreter by using the inbuilt modules and self created methods.\r\n\r\nThis project is the result of inspiration from many sources. I have referred lots of articles, blogs and books to Understand and develop this interpreter. I will try to share the resources and give credit wherever possible.\r\nPrinciples of Compiler Design by Alfred V.Aho and Jeffrey D.Ullman\r\nInside The Python Virtual Machine\r\nLetâ€™s Build A Simple Interpreter.\r\n\r\nThere are 3 Folders [ActionPlan] (https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/ActionPlan) -> Diagrams, Concepts brief, Algorithms Journey->I document and share my experiance on a day to day basis.The code will be explained . Every Day folder will contain the code built till that particular day. So that we can easily acess the improvement over time.\r\n\r\nThe Day-n.py file contains the code which you can pull and excecute it . It Support python 3.6+ For the latest version of the interpreter visit SourceCode Pull the Token.py Lexer.py file and interpreter.alng file compile and execute the interpreter file by passing the command below. $python3 interpreter.alng\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
