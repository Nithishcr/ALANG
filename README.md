This Project is a result of a long time dream of creating my own interpreter using python.
I chose python since I am very comfortable with it.
I am not going to use a virtual environment since I have decided to build this interpreter by using the inbuilt modules and self created methods.
This project is the result of inspiration from many sources.
I have referred lots of articles, blogs and books to Understand and develop this interpreter.
I will try to share the resources and give credit wherever possible
There are 3 Folders 
[ActionPlan] (https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/ActionPlan) -> Diagrams, Concepts brief, Algorithms
[Journey](https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/Journey)->I document and share my experiance on a day to day basis.The code will be explained . Every Day folder will contain the code built till that particular day. So that we can easily acess the improvement over time.

The Day-n.py file contains the code which you can pull and excecute it . It Support python 3.6+
For the lates version of the interpreter visit [SourceCode](https://github.com/anushkrishnav/Interpreter/tree/master/SourceCode)
Pull the Token.py file and interpreter.py file
compile and execute the interpreter file .
