I finnaly felt I was a prepared to take up a very challening task .Take a guess .
Yes finnaly a worthy challange our battles will be legendary.
I have decided to build a ...*Drum Roll*... Interpreter in Python .
I am a begginer in respect to all aspects will i be able to do it or will i quit defeatd i dont know .
I have given a look over how compiler and Interpreter works at article at geek for geek , and inside pvm
First thing first what is interpreter or compiler?
    Simply if a translator translates a source program into machine language, it is a compiler. If a translator processes and executes the source program without translating it into machine language first, it is an interpreter.
With the gained knowledge I decided to code a simple interpreter for a basic expression of adding 2 single digit Integers .

To achieve this :
I need to get input
I need to read the input
We first need to do Lexical analysis
    We need to break the input into components called Tokens
    A Token is an object which has value and a type
